##### 4. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?

> I encountered a problem where my plotly graph wasn't being represented in my shinyapps.  It turns out I just needed to change the plotOutput function into a plotlyOutput function.  Other than that, the only trouble came from tackling the plotly documentation which was just good practice.
